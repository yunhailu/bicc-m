Most of the time we send one of our staff to pick you up, but in some cases we may send a professional service provider to pick you up from PEK.

HSK test can be taken in a written format or <a href=\"http://cn.tanghsk.net/Experience/class1_index.html\">on a computer. </a></p>\n<p>BICC registers maximum HSK applicants than any other institute in China.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you want to pass HSK with high score, take our HSK preparation classes <a href=\"http://www.hibicc.com/programs\">here</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>The new HSK test was launched by Hanban in an effort to better serve Chinese language learners. The test is the result of coordinated efforts by experts from different disciplines including Chinese language teaching, linguistics, psychology and educational measurement. The new exam combines the advantages of the original HSK while taking into consideration recent trends in Chinese language training by conducting surveys and making use of the latest findings in international language testing.</p>\n<p><strong>I. Test Structure </strong><br /><br />\n\tThe new HSK is an international standardized exam that tests and rates Chinese language proficiency. It assesses non-native Chinese speakers abilities in using the Chinese language in their daily, academic and professional lives. The new HSK consists of a writing test and a speaking test, which are independent of each other. There are six levels of writing tests, namely the HSK (level I), HSK (level II), HSK (level III), HSK (level IV), HSK (level V), and HSK (level VI). There are three levels of speaking tests, namely the HSK (beginner level), HSK (intermediate level), and HSK (advanced level). During the speaking test, test takers' speeches will be recorded. </p>\n<p><strong>II. Test Levels</strong><br /><br />\n\tThe different levels of the new HSK are similar to some of the levels in the Chinese Language Proficiency Scales for Speakers of Other Languages (CLPS) and the Common European Framework of Reference (CEF); details are as follows:</p>\n<p>Test takers who are able to pass the HSK (Level I) can understand and use very simple Chinese phrases, meet basic needs for communication and possess the ability to further their Chinese language studies.<br /><br />\n\tTest takers who are able to pass the HSK (Level II) have an excellent grasp of basic Chinese and can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters.<br /><br />\n\tTest takers who are able to pass the HSK (Level III) can communicate in Chinese at a basic level in their daily, academic and professional lives. They can manage most communication in Chinese when travelling in China.<br /><br />\n\tTest takers who are able to pass the HSK (Level IV) can converse in Chinese on a wide range of topics and are able to communicate fluently with native Chinese speakers.<br /><br />\n\tTest takers who are able to pass the HSK (Level V) can read Chinese newspapers and magazines, enjoy Chinese films and plays, and give a full-length speech in Chinese.<br /><br />\n\tTest takers who are able to pass the HSK (Level VI) can easily comprehend written and spoken information in Chinese and can effectively express themselves in Chinese, both orally and on paper.</p>\n<p><strong>III. Test Principles</strong><br /><br />\n\tThe new HSK follows the principle of test-teaching correlation, bases the design of the test on the current trends in international Chinese language training, and is closely related to textbooks. The purpose of the test is to promote training through testing and promote learning through testing.<br /><br />\n\tThe new HSK emphasizes the objectivity and accuracy of the evaluation and stresses the learners actual Chinese language abilities.<br /><br />\n\tThe new HSK sets clear test objectives to allow the test takers to be able to improve their Chinese language abilities in a systematic and efficient way.</p>\n<p><strong>IV. Testing Purposes</strong><br /><br />\n\tThe new HSK retains the former HSK orientation as a general (or universal) Chinese language abilities test for adult learners. The results of the test can serve several purposes:<br /><br />\n\t- reference for an educational institution decision-making concerning recruiting students, assigning students to different classes, allowing students to skip certain courses and giving students academic credits.<br /><br />\n\t- reference for employers decision-making concerning the recruitment, training and promotion of test takers.<br /><br />\n\t- method for Chinese language learners to assess and improve their proficiency in Chinese.<br /><br />\n\t- method for Chinese language training institutions to evaluate training results.</p>\n<p><strong>V. Results Certificate</strong><br /><br />\n\tTest takers will receive the results for the new HSK issued by Hanban within three weeks after the test.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"HSK Preparation class \" title=\"HSK Preparation class\" style=\"height:650px; width:459px\" class=\"file-default media-element\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.hibicc.com/sites/hibicc.com/files/hsk%202018.jpeg\" width=\"750\" height=\"1062\" /></p>\n<p> ※ As the Spring Festival Holiday, the Results Released Date will be delay for one week</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>VII.
